# BERT_mail_classification
This repository contains code for spam email classification using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
BERT is a state-of-the-art language model that learns contextual representations of text. By fine-tuning BERT on a dataset of spam
and non-spam emails, we can create a highly accurate spam email classifier. The code provided includes data preprocessing, model training,
and evaluation scripts. We also provide pre-trained BERT models for easy deployment. With this project, you can efficiently classify emails
as spam or non-spam, enabling effective email filtering and enhancing overall email security.
